          <h2>Discover the earth</h2>
          <p>
            Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest Problems
            look mighty small from 150 miles up Posted by Start Bootstrap on
            August 24, 2023 Never in all their history have men been able truly
            to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having
            the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions
            eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or
            none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The
            airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in
            practice, not in theory.
          </p>
           <p>
            What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man
            set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds
            and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly
            changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are
            far more valuable than those which divide us.
          </p>

            The Final Frontier There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming
            for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to
            occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes,
            there is always the thrill of just beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching for the Stars As we got further and further away, it [the
            Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
            marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm,
            living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it
            with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to
            change a man. ... To go places and do things that have never been
            done before – that’s what living is all about. Space, the final
            frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its
            five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new
            life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone
            before. As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley,
            I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man
            must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.
